
1. Single Schema Architecture:

   
   - Advantages:
     - implicity: It is straightforward and easy to manage since there is only one schema to maintain.
     - Low Overhead: Requires fewer system resources because there is only one database instance.
     - Ease of Implementation: Quick and easy to set up, making it suitable for smaller applications or projects with straightforward data requirements.

  
2. Multi-Schema Architecture:

  
   - Advantages:
     - Improved Scalability: Allows for more granular control over data, making it suitable for larger, more complex applications.
     - Isolation of Data: Data can be isolated by functional area or module, providing enhanced security and regulatory compliance options.
     - Flexibility: Allows for customization of database structures to match specific application requirements.

  
3. Multi-Tenant Architecture:

   
   - Advantages:
     - Cost-Efficiency: Shared infrastructure leads to cost savings as resources are pooled across multiple tenants.
     - Scalability: Allows for efficient scaling to accommodate a growing number of tenants.
     - Resource Optimization: Maximizes resource utilization by allowing multiple tenants to share the same hardware and software resources.
